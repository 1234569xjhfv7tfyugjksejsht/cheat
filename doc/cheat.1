.SH FILES
.SS Configuration
.PP
\f[B]cheat\f[] is configured via a YAML file that is conventionally
named \f[I]conf.yaml\f[].
\f[B]cheat\f[] will search for \f[I]conf.yaml\f[] in varying locations,
depending upon your platform:
.SS Linux, OSX, and other Unixes
.IP "1." 3
\f[B]CHEAT_CONFIG_PATH\f[]
.IP "2." 3
\f[B]XDG_CONFIG_HOME\f[]/cheat/conf.yaml
.IP "3." 3
\f[B]$HOME\f[]/.config/cheat/conf.yml
.IP "4." 3
\f[B]$HOME\f[]/.cheat/conf.yml
.SS Windows
.IP "1." 3
\f[B]CHEAT_CONFIG_PATH\f[]
.IP "2." 3
\f[B]APPDATA\f[]/cheat/conf.yml
.IP "3." 3
\f[B]PROGRAMDATA\f[]/cheat/conf.yml
.PP
\f[B]cheat\f[] will search in the order specified above.
The first \f[I]conf.yaml\f[] encountered will be respected.
.PP
If \f[B]cheat\f[] cannot locate a config file, it will ask if you\[aq]d
like to generate one automatically.
Alternatively, you may also generate a config file manually by running
\f[B]cheat \-\-init\f[] and saving its output to the appropriate
location for your platform.
.SS Cheatpaths
.PP
\f[B]cheat\f[] reads its cheatsheets from "cheatpaths", which are the
directories in which cheatsheets are stored.
Cheatpaths may be configured in \f[I]conf.yaml\f[], and viewed via
\f[B]cheat \-d\f[].
.PP
For detailed instructions on how to configure cheatpaths, please refer
to the comments in conf.yml.
.SS Autocompletion
.PP
Autocompletion scripts for \f[B]bash\f[], \f[B]zsh\f[], and
\f[B]fish\f[] are available for download:
.IP \[bu] 2
<https://github.com/cheat/cheat/blob/master/scripts/cheat.bash>
.IP \[bu] 2
<https://github.com/cheat/cheat/blob/master/scripts/cheat.fish>
.IP \[bu] 2
<https://github.com/cheat/cheat/blob/master/scripts/cheat.zsh>
.PP
The \f[B]bash\f[] and \f[B]zsh\f[] scripts provide optional integration
with \f[B]fzf\f[], if the latter is available on your \f[B]PATH\f[].
.PP
The installation process will vary per system and shell configuration,
and thus will not be discussed here.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B \f[B]CHEAT_CONFIG_PATH\f[]
The path at which the config file is available.
If \f[B]CHEAT_CONFIG_PATH\f[] is set, all other config paths will be
ignored.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[B]CHEAT_USE_FZF\f[]
